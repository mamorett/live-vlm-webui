## 🔧 v0.1.1 Improvements (Future Release)

### Release Process Improvements

- [ ] **Add versioned Docker image tags via git tags**
  - **Issue**: Currently only `latest` Docker tags exist for v0.1.0
  - **Improvement**: Create git tags for releases to trigger versioned builds
  - **Action** (for v0.1.1):
    ```bash
    git tag v0.1.1
    git push origin v0.1.1
    ```
  - **Benefit**: Users can pin to specific Docker versions (e.g., `v0.1.1`)
  - **Note**: Workflow already configured with `type=semver` patterns
  - **Priority**: Medium - Good practice for production deployments
  - **For v0.1.0**: Can retroactively tag if needed, but not critical

- [ ] **Document release process for future releases**
  - Create step-by-step guide in `docs/development/RELEASING.md`
  - Include: version bump, changelog, git tag, GitHub release, PyPI upload, Docker verification
  - Standard operating procedure for maintainers
  - Priority: Medium

  - Line 38: PyPI package warning
  - Line 191: Download button mention

- [ ] **Add CHANGELOG.md maintenance**
  - Add [Unreleased] section for future changes
  - Document ongoing changes as they're made

- [ ] **Update troubleshooting.md**
  - Monitor user feedback for common installation issues
  - Add new platform-specific issues as discovered

### Features & Enhancements

- [ ] **Jetson GPU stats without jtop dependency** (Platform Support - HIGH PRIORITY)
  - **Current issue**: jtop (jetson-stats) requirement complicates pip wheel installation
  - **Goal**: Direct GPU utilization and VRAM consumption retrieval
  - **Approaches**:
    - Wait for future L4T release with updated NVML support for Thor
    - Investigate lower-level interfaces (sysfs, tegrastats alternatives)
    - Direct GPU metrics access without Python dependencies
  - **Benefits**:
    - Simpler pip installation (no jetson-stats complexity)
    - More efficient monitoring
    - Better user experience for pip-based installs
  - **Additional feature**: Stacked memory consumption graph for UMA systems
    - Jetson and DGX Spark use Unified Memory Architecture
    - Current sparklines don't show memory composition well
    - Consider chart library upgrade for better UMA visualization
  - Priority: High (significantly improves Jetson pip installation experience)

- [ ] **Multi-user/multi-session support** (Architecture - critical for cloud hosting)
  - **Current limitation**: Single-user, single-session architecture
    - If accessed by multiple users, they share same VLM service instance and see each other's outputs
    - Settings changes affect all connected users
    - Only one VLM inference at a time (sequential processing)
  - **Required for**: Cloud deployment, team demos, production use
  - **Implementation levels**:
    - **Level 1 (Basic)**: Session management with isolated VLM state per user
      - Session IDs for WebSocket connections
      - Per-session VLM service instances
      - Targeted message broadcasting (not broadcast to all)
      - Effort: ~8-12 hours
      - Supports: 10-20 concurrent users
    - **Level 2 (Efficient)**: Shared VLM backend with request queue
      - Request queue with session context
      - Fair scheduling and rate limiting per user
      - Batching for efficiency
      - Effort: ~16-24 hours
      - Supports: 20-50 concurrent users
    - **Level 3 (Enterprise)**: Distributed scalable architecture
      - Stateless frontend servers
      - Redis/database for session state
      - Separate VLM service layer with load balancing
      - Authentication & authorization
      - Multi-tenancy support
      - Effort: ~4-8 weeks (major rewrite)
      - Supports: 100+ concurrent users
  - **Current workaround**: Deploy multiple independent instances on different ports
    - Run separate Python processes or containers, each on different port
    - Works without code changes, suitable for 5-10 users
  - Priority: Med (required if to host this web UI on some public instance)

- [ ] **Hardware-accelerated video processing on Jetson** (Performance)
  - Location: `src/live_vlm_webui/video_processor.py:19`
  - Description: Implement NVMM/VPI color space conversion
  - Priority: Medium (optimization, not blocking)
  - Benefit: Reduce CPU load during video processing

- [ ] **Display detailed VLM inference metrics** (UI/Metrics)
  - **Current state**: Only showing total latency (ms), avg latency, inference count
  - **Goal**: Display detailed breakdown of VLM inference phases
  - **Background**: VLM inference has two distinct phases:
    - **Prefill phase** (prompt processing): Image encoding + prompt → KV cache population
      - Duration: 500-2000ms for VLMs (image encoding is expensive)
      - User experience: Long pause before any text appears
    - **Decode phase** (token generation): Generate tokens one-by-one
      - Duration: Depends on response length and GPU speed
      - User experience: Text appears word-by-word after prefill
  - **Metrics to display**:
    1. **Prefill time** (ms) - "Time to first token" - shows image processing overhead
    2. **Decode speed** (tokens/sec) - "Generation speed" - shows GPU efficiency
    3. **Total time** (ms) - Already showing as "Latency"
    4. **Tokens generated** - Response length
    5. **Vision tokens** - Number of tokens from image (optional, technical detail)
  - **Implementation**:
    - **Ollama**: API returns rich metrics in response object
      ```python
      {
        "prompt_eval_count": 577,        # text + vision tokens
        "prompt_eval_duration": 1500000000,  # nanoseconds (prefill)
        "eval_count": 25,                # generated tokens
        "eval_duration": 1250000000,     # nanoseconds (decode)
      }
      # Calculate:
      # prefill_ms = prompt_eval_duration / 1e6
      # decode_tokens_per_sec = eval_count / (eval_duration / 1e9)
      ```
    - **vLLM**: Check if response object includes timing metadata (may not be available via OpenAI-compatible API)
      - Open WebUI likely has same limitation
      - May need to use vLLM-specific endpoint or parse response headers
    - **Other backends**: Show "N/A" gracefully if metrics unavailable
  - **UI changes**:
    - Add metrics to inline display: "Prefill: Xms | Gen: Y tok/s | Tokens: Z"
    - Update WebSocket `vlm_response` message format
    - Update `vlm_service.py` to extract and return detailed metrics
    - Consider collapsible "Advanced Metrics" section for technical details
  - **Note**: Need to detect backend type or parse response metadata structure
  - Priority: Medium (valuable for performance analysis and model comparison)
  - Benefit: Users can see where time is spent (image encoding vs text generation), essential for r/LocalLLaMA community

- [ ] **Multi-frame temporal understanding** (Features - HIGH IMPACT)
  - **Goal**: Enable VLM to understand motion, actions, and changes over time
  - **Current limitation**: Each frame is analyzed independently with no temporal context
  - **Use cases**:
    - Action recognition ("person is waving", "car is turning left")
    - Motion detection ("object is moving from left to right")
    - Change detection ("door just opened", "person entered the frame")
    - Temporal reasoning ("person picked up cup then drank from it")
  - **Technical approaches**:

    **Option 1: Multi-image API (Recommended if supported)**
    - Send multiple frames (e.g., 4-8 frames) in a single API request
    - VLM processes them together with temporal understanding
    - **Supported by**:
      - ✅ GPT-4V / GPT-4o (OpenAI) - supports multiple images in one prompt
      - ✅ Claude 3 (Anthropic) - supports multiple images
      - ✅ Gemini (Google) - native video understanding
      - ❓ Ollama - depends on underlying model (need to test)
      - ❓ vLLM - depends on model architecture
    - **API format** (OpenAI-compatible):
      ```python
      messages = [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
          {"type": "text", "text": "What action is happening across these frames?"},
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}},  # frame 1
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}},  # frame 2
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}},  # frame 3
          {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."}},  # frame 4
        ]
      }]
      ```
    - **Pros**: Native temporal understanding, best quality
    - **Cons**: Requires backend support, higher latency, more VRAM

    **Option 2: Grid/collage approach (Universal fallback)**
    - Combine 4-8 frames into a single grid image (e.g., 2x2 or 2x4 layout)
    - Add frame numbers/timestamps as text overlay
    - Send as one image with prompt: "These frames show a sequence over time. Describe what's happening."
    - **Pros**: Works with ANY VLM, simpler implementation
    - **Cons**:
      - Loss of resolution per frame (4 frames = 50% resolution each dimension)
      - Model must understand spatial grid layout
      - Less effective than native multi-image support
    - **Example layout**:
      ```
      [Frame 1: t=0.0s] [Frame 2: t=0.5s]
      [Frame 3: t=1.0s] [Frame 4: t=1.5s]
      ```

    **Option 3: Conversation/sliding window (Advanced)**
    - Maintain conversation history with last N frames
    - Each new frame references previous frames in context
    - Requires conversation state management
    - **Pros**: Can maintain longer temporal context
    - **Cons**: Complex state management, context window limits, may not work well

    **Option 4: Video-native VLMs (Future)**
    - Use models specifically designed for video understanding
    - Examples: LLaVA-Video, Video-LLaMA, Video-ChatGPT, Qwen2-VL
    - These models have temporal attention mechanisms
    - **Pros**: Best temporal understanding
    - **Cons**: Limited model availability, requires backend changes

  - **Implementation plan**:
    1. Add frame buffer to `VideoProcessorTrack` to store last N frames
    2. Add UI toggle: "Temporal Mode" with frame count selection (2-8 frames)
    3. Implement grid stitching as universal fallback (Option 2)
    4. Detect backend capabilities and use multi-image API if available (Option 1)
    5. Add temporal-specific prompts: "Describe the motion/action across these frames"
    6. Update metrics to show "frames per inference" and "temporal window"

  - **UI considerations**:
    - Toggle: "Single Frame" vs "Temporal (4 frames)" vs "Temporal (8 frames)"
    - Frame rate adjustment: Slower frame rate for temporal mode (e.g., 1 FPS instead of 0.5 FPS)
    - Visual indicator showing which frames are being analyzed
    - Latency will be higher (4x frames = ~2-4x longer prefill time)

  - **Performance impact**:
    - **Prefill time**: Increases linearly with frame count (4 frames ≈ 4x prefill time)
    - **VRAM**: Increases with frame count (more vision tokens in KV cache)
    - **Inference rate**: Must be slower (wait for N frames to accumulate)
    - Example: 4 frames @ 1 FPS = 4 seconds of temporal context, ~4-8 sec total latency

  - **Testing needed**:
    - Test Ollama with different vision models (llava, llama3.2-vision) for multi-image support
    - Test vLLM with multi-image capable models
    - Measure latency/VRAM impact with different frame counts
    - Evaluate quality: multi-image API vs grid approach

  - Priority: High (major feature, high user demand for action/motion understanding)
  - Effort: ~2-3 days for basic implementation (grid approach), +1-2 days for multi-image API
  - Benefit: Unlocks entirely new use cases (action recognition, motion tracking, surveillance, robotics)

- [ ] **Download button for recordings** (UI)
  - Mentioned in README line 191: "Download button (coming soon)"
  - Priority: Low (nice-to-have, not essential)

- [ ] **AMD GPU monitoring support** (Platform Support)
  - Priority: Low (expand platform support, not near-term)
  - Requires: ROCm/rocm-smi integration
  - Note: Removed "coming soon" from README to avoid incorrect expectations

- [x] **WSL support verification and fix** (Platform Support)
  - ✅ **Tested and working** on WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04
  - ✅ GPU inference works (CUDA support confirmed)
  - ✅ Ollama running inside WSL works perfectly
  - ✅ **GPU monitoring fixed!** - WSL2 has intermittent NVML errors, now handled with retry logic
    - Root cause: WSL2's NVML occasionally returns `NVMLError_Unknown` (transient error, not fundamental limitation)
    - Fix: Added automatic retry logic - only disables after 10+ consecutive errors
    - Recovery: Automatically recovers when NVML calls succeed again
    - Behavior: May show 0% briefly during intermittent errors, then recovers
  - ❌ **Doesn't work:** Ollama on Windows + WebUI on WSL (networking issue)
    - Windows Ollama only listens on `127.0.0.1`, not accessible from WSL network
    - Solution: Install Ollama inside WSL instead
  - 📝 **Documentation:** Created comprehensive guide at `docs/usage/windows-wsl.md`
  - 🐛 **Code fix:** `src/live_vlm_webui/gpu_monitor.py` - resilient error handling
  - Priority: Complete and fixed for v0.1.1
