# Cursor AI Personal Reference Documentation

This directory is for **your personal reference documentation** created during development sessions with Cursor AI.

## ⚠️ Not in Upstream Repo

**This directory exists only on your local machine:**
- ❌ **NOT committed to git** (in `.gitignore`)
- ❌ **NOT found in upstream repo** when cloning
- ✅ Each developer has their own `docs/cursor/` with their own content

## Purpose

- 📝 Explains decisions and context from YOUR specific development work
- 🔍 Provides detailed explanations for YOUR specific issues/questions
- 📚 Serves as YOUR reference for understanding "why" decisions were made
- 🤖 Created by Cursor AI during your sessions

## Example Files (Yours Will Be Different)

These are examples of what YOU might have - but each developer's content is different:

- `INTEGRATION_VS_E2E_EXPLANATION.md` - Explanation of testing approaches
- `YOUR_FEATURE_DESIGN.md` - Design decisions for your feature
- `DEBUGGING_NOTES.md` - Notes from debugging your specific issue
- `PERFORMANCE_INVESTIGATION.md` - Notes from your performance work

## General Documentation

For **general, user-facing documentation**, see:
- `../` - General docs directory
- `../../tests/README.md` - Testing guide
- `../../README.md` - Main project documentation

## Guidelines (from `.cursorrules`)

Put docs here if they:
- ✅ Explain decisions made in a specific conversation
- ✅ Address "your issue" or "your question"
- ✅ Are written conversationally (addressing "you")
- ✅ Provide context for specific development sessions
- ✅ Are reference material, not general documentation

Put docs elsewhere if they:
- ❌ Are general documentation for any user/contributor
- ❌ Should be committed to git
- ❌ Are written for a general audience
- ❌ Document features/APIs/usage

## Note

This directory is `.gitignore`d - these docs stay local on your machine and provide context for your development work.
